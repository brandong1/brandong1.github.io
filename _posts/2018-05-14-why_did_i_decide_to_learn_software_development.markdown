What's up, everyone? Brandon Green here.

I'm currently a student of Flatiron School's Full Stack Web Development program and all things considered, I'm loving it! I have found a joy in programming that I've not experienced in a long time and I can't wait to see what I'm capable of accomplishing once my skills improve.

So, the reason I'm here today is to answer the question: Why did I decide to learn software development?

I've ALWAYS had an interest in learning software development, but have only recently really had a **need** to learn it. Now, with my current job satisfaction dwindling due to lack of challenge and mental stimulation, the drive to learn programming and start on a new career path is more appealing than ever.

I've dabbled in programming for years, but I was never consistent enough to make progress and a lot of the learning platforms I've used didn't provide the support and guidance I needed to learn effectively. Flatiron School has been a diamond in the rough for me and I truly love the community spirit and access to technical coaches who have actually gone through the program and aren't just information givers.

I'd also love to make a multimillion-dollar app! =P

I'm looking forward to documenting my coding journey here!
