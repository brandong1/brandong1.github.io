It's been pretty difficult for me to focus on the cirriculum because everytime I get stuck and have to Google a concept, I end up going down a rabbit hole. Between practicing coding the concepts I'm trying to master, and just not feeling like I'm picking this up as fast as I should, I spent more cycles trying to reinforce the lesson I'm learning at Flatiron using external resources (writing practice code in Visual Studio Code and reading beginner guides/books.

It's strange because, when I'm "In the Zone" and solving lab after lab like a champ, I can stay focused for hours. But the moment I come across something I don't master immediately, I spend lots of cycles just researching concepts, reading through others' code on StackOverflow for inspiration on how I can get some of my tests to pass. 

Funny thing is, I always end up using a method I learned days, weeks ago that I had forgot about. I'm guessing, and hoping  that being able to recall all the coding tools in my toolbox will come with time and repetition.
