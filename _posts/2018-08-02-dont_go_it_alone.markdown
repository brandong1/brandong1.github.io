One of the most terrifying things I've experienced at Flatiron School is the feeling of being alone.

For the first two months of the Online Web Developer cirriculum, I thought I was the only one struggling to get through some of the more complex labs. Each successive hurdle I'd think: "I feel like I should know this" or "Since I don't feel like I'm getting better, or it's not getting easier, maybe I'm not meant to be a programmer." Those were my thoughts every single day and I actually almost quit a few times.

Now that I am in the beta for the structured program, I have been reassured, through conversations with my classmates, that everyone felt the same way I did. 

I started hosting a Study Group Monday through Thursday for my classmates to come together and work through their challenges, network and understand that they are not alone. By putting out collective minds together, we've been able to work our way through some of the challenges we faced with our CLI Data Gem and I can honestly say that without them, I feel like I would not have been able to complete it in the timeframe that I did.

So, don't be shy, ask your fellow students for help, or offer them your assistance. If nothing else, it's a great way to network!
